[WOTC] Iridar's Templar Shield

This mod replaces Templars' Parry ability with [b]Templar Shield[/b]. When activated, Templar Shield grants 4/7/10 Shield HP until the start of your next turn. It can be used with both regular and Momentum action points.

This is essentially a nerf to Templars, as Parry is extremely powerful by itself. The upside is that Templar Shield can be used to block multiple weaker attacks, is not consumed by attacks that would have missed the Templar, and does not require using Rend first.

[h1]REQUIREMENTS[/h1]
[list]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1134256495][b]X2 WOTC Community Highlander[/b][/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2363075446][b][WOTC] Iridar's Template Master - Core[/b][/url]
[*] [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1416242202][b]WotC Ballistic Shields[/b][/url] - required only for animations.
[*] Safe to add mid-campaign, existing soldiers will be affected immediately starting with the next tactical mission.[/list]

[h1]COMPATIBILITY[/h1]

The mod looks specifically for the "Parry" ability and replaces it. Abilities with other template names, like Proficiency Templars' Parry, will not be affected.
[list][*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2683996590]Long War of the Chosen[/url][/b] - Compatible, but will not do anything, LWOTC Templars do not use Parry. This mod will be integrated into LWOTC in the future.
[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2496297018][WOTC] Proficiency Class Plugin: Templar[/url][/b] - compatible, but since Proficiency Templars use their own unique version of Parry, Templar Shield does not replace it, and instead it can randomly appear as an XCOM row perk for ranks 5 through 7.
[/list]

The amount of Shield HP granted by Templar Shield needs to be configured for each Shard Gauntlet. The mod contains configuration for Shard Gauntlets from mods mentioned below. Other mod-added Shard Gauntlets will not grant any Shield HP, unless specifically configured otherwise.

[*] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1593890402][WOTC] One Handed Templar by Iridar[/url][/b] - very funny. Shield is generated by the shard gauntlet on the left arm. No arm - no shield. If Templar Shield is used with a one handed shard gauntlet, it will not grant any Shield HP, intentionally.

[h1]CONFIGURATION[/h1]

Amount of Shield HP granted by Templar Shield by various gauntlets is configurable in:
[code]..\steamapps\workshop\content\268500\2664422411\Config\XComTemplateEditor.ini[/code]

The part of the mod that replaces Parry with Templar Shield can be disabled in case some other mod wants to use this mod as a Perk Pack that just adds a new ability without otherwise impacting the game.

[h1]COOKED ASSETS[/h1]

Thanks to Xymanek, this mod's packages are cooked to reduce their size and improve loading times. However, Unreal Editor is unable to open cooked packages, so if for whatever reason you need to inspect this mod's packages, you can find the uncooked version of the mod on [b][url=https://github.com/Iridar/WOTCIridarTemplarParryRework]GitHub[/url][/b].
